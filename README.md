# MIT xPro Project ðŸ’»
This is one of the projects I was working on to get my professional certificate in Full Stack Development by MIT xPro. 
If you are curious about this rigorous program you can learn more about it [here](https://youtu.be/5CiCtj_2Qsg).

## Real Time Bus Tracking
This will track in real time Boston's Bus #1 locations, during it's route. It enables you to see Boston's bus route number one location on a map in real-time. The bus route's include bus stops between MIT and Harvard. The bus tracker uses MBTA API to retrieve the bus location every 15 seconds. This project is a display of asynchronous programming and map manipulation through Javascript.

### *Usage*: 
1. link to the file 
2. Wait 15 seconds to see the updated bus location (Do not change the timeout setting to less than 15 seconds, in order not to be banned from MBTA data servers) 

### *Roadmap*
Next versions will show the route and number of seats availabe on the bus
